## About

**Background**. I am currently a Postdoc at Yale University, working with [Prof. Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Irwin King](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MXvC7tkAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research Interests**. My research is primarily focused on exploring the connection and alignment between the **learning space**, especially the hyperbolic space, and **the underlying geometries, structures and patterns** in different types of data.

**Recently, I has been working the following topics:**

(1) Hyperbolic representation learning, curvature adaptive learning, differential geometry

(2) Foundation models, generative model, alignment across multi-source data, non-Euclidean space for foundation models

(3) Recommender systems, network sciences, and AI4SCI

Feel free to reach out if you have anything you would like to discuss. Besides, I will join HKUSTGZ in 2025, information about PhD student recruitment can be found at the PDFs: [Chinese Version](./assets/bibliography/digailab_re.pdf), [English Version](./assets/bibliography/digailab_en.pdf).
